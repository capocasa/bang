GLFM Android Example
===

This is a GLFM android example project and starting point for an android build.

Simplied from a glfm example.

Instructions
---

```sh
# symlink glfm source
cd glfman/app/src/main/cpp
ln -s /path/to/glfm glfm

# build
cd glfman/app
./gradlew
```

This is tested on linux without android studio but *should* work on other OS as well. On Windows, you probably need to copy instead of symlink.
